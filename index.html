    <h1>Maryland CS Jobs</h1>
</header>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We made this site to advertise a few Maryland jobs and encourage different thinking about computer science jobs. Google, Facebook, and Silicon Valley startups aren&rsquo;t the only type of great tech job.</p>

<h2>Why Work There?</h2>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>Many Maryland tech companies are associated with the US Department of Defense. They have close ties to local locations of higher education such as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland_(disambiguation)">University of Maryland</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_University">Georgetown University</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University">George Washington University</a>, and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University">Johns Hopkins University</a>. There are many medical schools and world-class hospitals. As such, most tech companies, especially those linked above, provide better-than-normal health benefits, education programs, Masters degree programs, travel and relocation benefits, and paid time off.</p>

<h3>BYU Students Fit Well</h3>
<p>BYU students are particularly good fits for many of these organizations. Reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Employees often need <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance">security clearances</a>. Such employees would need to be lifelong law-abiding citizens, honest, and patriotic. Illegal drug use is obviously a hurdle to receiving a clearance, but abstinence from drugs, alcohol, and other such influences gives the applicant a major advantage.</li>
    <li>These organizations need language skills. Some even have elaborate tests to determine your ability to learn languages and pay you handsomely for your skills. Some invest a lot to train specialists in unique languages like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarani_language">Guarani</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language">Farsi</a>.</li>
    <li>These organizations call for responsibility and moral character. And, they understand that their interests include that their employees are healthy mentally and emotionally, that they uphold the law, and that they are honest. Many jobs are connected to military projects. Furthermore, they are not making consumer products. A project for a probe meant for Pluto places priority on good design and testing rather than ease of production and marketability.</li>
</ul>
